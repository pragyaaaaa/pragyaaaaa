I write codes, of course.
But along with it, I love learning about how stuff works- right from earphones to ever-expanding universe. I can geek out over absolute luminosity of stars, yet, at times, I spend nights on planning UI components and figuring out data flow without a single line of code.
In nutshell, my passion for programming is coupled with love for understanding the big-picture which sets technology to make sense.
Fun fact: I'm a great fan of Star Wars, but, I kinda hate Avengers.
